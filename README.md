## What it is

_DB Browser for SQLite_ (DB4S) is a high quality, visual, open source tool to
create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.

DB4S is for users and developers who want to create, search, and edit
databases.  DB4S uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, so complicated SQL commands do not have to be learned.

Controls and wizards are available for users to:

* Create and compact database files
* Create, define, modify and delete tables
* Create, define, and delete indexes
* Browse, edit, add, and delete records
* Search records
* Import and export records as text
* Import and export tables from/to CSV files
* Import and export databases from/to SQL dump files
* Issue SQL queries and inspect the results
* Examine a log of all SQL commands issued by the application
* Plot simple graphs based on table or query data

## What it is not

Even though DB4S comes with a spreadsheet-like interface, it is not meant to replace your spreadsheet application.
We implement a few convenience functions which go beyond a simple database frontend but do not add them when they
do not make sense in a database context or are so complex to implement that they will only ever be a poor
replacement for your favorite spreadsheet application. We are a small team with limited time after all. Thanks
for your understanding :)

https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki.

## Continuous, Nightly builds

Download continuous builds for AppImage and macOS here:

* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/continuous
> Note: A continuous build is generated when a new commit is added to the `master` branch.<br>
> Builds for Windows are not currently available. but there are plans to add them in 2023.

Download nightly builds for Windows and macOS here:

* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/latest

## Windows

Download Windows releases here:

* https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/#windows

Or use Chocolatey:

```
choco install sqlitebrowser
```

Or use winget:

```
winget install -e --id DBBrowserForSQLite.DBBrowserForSQLite
```

**Note:** If for some reason the standard Windows release does not work
(e.g. gives an error), try a [nightly build](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser?tab=readme-ov-file#nightly-builds). Nightly builds often fix bugs
reported after the last release. :D

## macOS

DB Browser for SQLite works well on macOS.

* macOS 10.15 (Catalina) - 14.0 (Sonoma) are tested and known to work.

#### Stable release

Download macOS releases here:

* https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/#macos

The latest macOS binary can be installed via [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/ "Homebrew Cask"):

```
brew install --cask db-browser-for-sqlite
```

#### Continuous, Nightly builds

Continuous builds are available here:

* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/continuous

Nightly builds are available here:
* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/latest

and also you can be installed via [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/ "Homebrew Cask"):

```
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions

# for the version without SQLCipher support
brew install --cask db-browser-for-sqlite-nightly

# for the version with SQLCipher support
brew install --cask db-browser-for-sqlcipher-nightly
```

It also has its own Homebrew tap the include Cask for older version.<br>
For more information, see the following: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/homebrew-tap

## Linux

DB Browser for SQLite works well on Linux.

### Arch Linux

Arch Linux provides an [up to date version](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/sqlitebrowser/)

Install with the following command:

    sudo pacman -S sqlitebrowser

### Debian

Debian focuses more on stability rather than newest features.<br>
Therefore packages will typically contain an older (but well tested) version, compared to the latest release.

Update the cache using:

    sudo apt-get update

Install the package using:

    sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser

### Fedora

Install for Fedora (i386 and x86_64) by issuing the following command:

    sudo dnf install sqlitebrowser
    
### openSUSE

    sudo zypper install sqlitebrowser

### Ubuntu and Derivatives

#### Stable release

For Ubuntu and derivatives, [@deepsidhu1313](https://github.com/deepsidhu1313)
provides a PPA with the latest release here:

* https://launchpad.net/~linuxgndu/+archive/ubuntu/sqlitebrowser

To add this PPA just type in this command in terminal:

    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:linuxgndu/sqlitebrowser

Then update the cache using:

    sudo apt-get update

Install the package using:

    sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser

Packages for Older Ubuntu releases are supported while launchpad keeps building those or if Older Ubuntu release has dependency packages that are required to build the latest version of Sqlitebrowser. We don't remove builds from our ppa repos, so users can still install older version of sqlitebrowser if they like. Alternatively Linux users can also switch to Snap packages if Snap packages are supported by the distro they are using.

#### Nightly builds

Nightly builds are available here:

* https://launchpad.net/~linuxgndu/+archive/ubuntu/sqlitebrowser-testing

To add this PPA, type these commands into the terminal:

    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:linuxgndu/sqlitebrowser-testing

Then update the cache using:

    sudo apt-get update

Install the package using:

    sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser

### Other Linux

On others, compile DB4S using the instructions in [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).

## FreeBSD

DB Browser for SQLite works well on FreeBSD, and there is a port for it (thanks
to [lbartoletti](https://github.com/lbartoletti) :smile:).<br>DB4S can be installed
using either this command:

    make -C /usr/ports/databases/sqlitebrowser install

or this command:

    pkg install sqlitebrowser

## Snap packages

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/sqlitebrowser)

#### Snap Nightlies

     snap install sqlitebrowser --devmode

#### Snap Stable

     snap install sqlitebrowser


## Compiling

Instructions for compiling on Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD are

## History

This program was developed originally by Mauricio Piacentini
([@piacentini](https://github.com/piacentini)) from Tabuleiro Producoes as
the Arca Database Browser. The original version was used as a free companion
tool to the Arca Database Xtra, a commercial product that embeds SQLite
databases with some additional extensions to handle compressed and binary data.

The original code was trimmed and adjusted to be compatible with standard
SQLite 2.x databases. The resulting program was renamed SQLite Database
Browser, and released into the Public Domain by Mauricio. Icons were
contributed by [Raquel Ravanini](http://www.raquelravanini.com), also from
Tabuleiro. Jens Miltner ([@jmiltner](https://github.com/jmiltner)) contributed
the code to support SQLite 3.x databases for the 1.2 release.

Pete Morgan ([@daffodil](https://github.com/daffodil)) created an initial
project on GitHub with the code in 2012, where several contributors fixed and
improved pieces over the years. René Peinthor ([@rp-](https://github.com/rp-))
and Martin Kleusberg ([@MKleusberg](https://github.com/MKleusberg)) then
became involved, and have been the main driving force from that point.  Justin
Clift ([@justinclift](https://github.com/justinclift)) helps out with testing
on OSX, and started the new github.com/sqlitebrowser organisation on GitHub.

[John T. Haller](https://johnhaller.com), of
[PortableApps.com](https://portableapps.com) fame, created the new logo.  He
based it on the Tango icon set (public domain).

In August 2014, the project was renamed to "Database Browser for SQLite" at
the request of [Richard Hipp](https://www.hwaci.com/drh) (creator of
[SQLite](https://sqlite.org)), as the previous name was creating unintended
support issues.

In September 2014, the project was renamed to "DB Browser for SQLite", to
avoid confusion with an existing application called "Database Browser".

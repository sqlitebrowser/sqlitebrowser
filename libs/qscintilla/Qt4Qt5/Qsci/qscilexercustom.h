//! \brief The QsciLexerCustom class is an abstract class used as a base for
//! new language lexers.
//!
//! The advantage of implementing a new lexer this way (as opposed to adding
//! the lexer to the underlying Scintilla code) is that it does not require the
//! QScintilla library to be re-compiled.  It also makes it possible to
//! integrate external lexers.
//!
//! All that is necessary to implement a new lexer is to define appropriate
//! styles and to re-implement the styleText() method.

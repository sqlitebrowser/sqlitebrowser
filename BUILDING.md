## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS

DB Browser for SQLite requires Qt as well as SQLite.<br>
For more information on Qt please consult http://www.qt.io and for SQLite please see https://sqlite.org/.

Please note that all versions after 3.12.1 will require:
* A C++ compiler with support for C++14 or later
* Qt 5.15.9 later

Without these or with older versions you won't be able to compile DB Browser for
SQLite any more.<br>This applies to all platforms. However, most likely you won't
have to worry about these as most systems meet these requirements today.

If you can, please use Qt 5.15.9 or any later version.<br>Even though Qt
5.5 and 5.6 are supported by us, there might be glitches and minor problems
when using them.<br>
Also, it is not possible to build universal binary for macOS using Qt versions lower than 5.15.9.

The wiki has information that is a bit more detailed or less common, but may be useful: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki

### Linux
#### Generic Linux and FreeBSD

The only requirements for building this code are the presence of Qt5 and
SQLite 3.<br>Qt can be included as a static or shared library, depending on the
current Qt configuration on the building machine.

Provided you have Qt and cmake installed and configured, simply run:

    cmake .

There is one potential problem... several Linux distributions provide a
QScintilla package compiled for (only) Qt4.  If it's present it can confuse
CMake, which will use it during compiling.  The resulting program just crashes
instead of running.  If you experience that kind of crash, try using this
cmake command instead when compiling:

    cmake -DFORCE_INTERNAL_QSCINTILLA=ON

That tells cmake to compile QScintilla itself, using the source code version
we bundle.

After the cmake line, run this:

    make

in the main directory. This will generate the sqlitebrowser (or
`sqlitebrowser.exe`, or `sqlitebrowser.app`) application in the src subdirectory.
On some distributions you can then install this in the correct places by
running:

    sudo make install

The same process works for building the code in any platform supported by Qt
(including other Unix systems with X11.)

#### CentOS / Fedora Linux

>**Note** - On CentOS or an older version of Fedora, you may need to use `yum` instead of `dnf`.<br>
>**Note 2** - On CentOS 7.x, you need to replace the `qwt-qt5-devel` package name with
`qt5-qtbase-devel` in the `dnf install` line.<br>
>**Note 3** - On CentOS 8 (Stream), you need to replace the `qt-devel` package name with `qt5-devel` in the `dnf install` line below.<br>
>Make sure the `PowerTools` repo is enabled. For further information: https://access.redhat.com/discussions/5417621

```bash
sudo dnf install cmake gcc-c++ git qt-devel qt5-linguist qwt-qt5-devel sqlite-devel
git clone https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser
cd sqlitebrowser
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

This should complete without errors, and `sqlitebrowser` should now be launch-able from the command line.

#### Debian / Ubuntu Linux

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake git libqcustomplot-dev libqt5scintilla2-dev libsqlcipher-dev \
    libsqlite3-dev qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev qtbase5-dev-tools qtchooser qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools
git clone https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser
cd sqlitebrowser
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

>**Note** - Use `cmake -DFORCE_INTERNAL_QSCINTILLA=ON -Dsqlcipher=1 -Wno-dev ..`<br>
>if you're using Debian and meet errors during compiling.

This should complete without errors, giving you an executable file called `sqlitebrowser`. Done. :)

> Also, we have a CI workflow for Ubuntu, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-ubuntu.yml)

#### OpenSUSE

```bash
zypper in -y build build, cmake, gcc, gcc-c++, git-core, libQt5Core5, libQt5Core5-32bit, libqt5-qtbase, libqt5-qtbase-devel, libqt5-qttools, libqt5-qttools-devel, libsqlite3-0, sqlcipher-devel, sqlite3-devel
git clone https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser
cd sqlitebrowser
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DFORCE_INTERNAL_QSCINTILLA=ON ..
make
sudo make install
```

### macOS

#### Build an `.app` bundle
The application can be compiled to an .app bundle, suitable for placing in
/Applications.

Building an .app bundle version takes a bit more effort, but isn't too hard.<br>
It requires SQLite and at least Qt 5.15.9 to be installed first. These are the
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) steps, though other package managers should work:

```bash
brew tap sqlitebrowser/tap
# If you are using Apple Silicon Mac
brew install db4subqt@5 db4subsqlcipher db4subsqlitefts@5
# If you are using Intel Mac
brew install db4sqt@5 db4ssqlcipher db4ssqlitefts@5
```
> You can don't need SQLCipher support, you can skip `db4ssqlcipher` and `db4ssqlitefts@5`.

Then it's just a matter of getting the source:

    $ git clone https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.git

**Note** - Don't clone the repo to a directory with a quote character (') in
its name (eg ~/tmp/foo'), as compiling will error out.

And compiling it:

```bash
cd sqlitebrowser
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DcustomTap=1 ..
cmake --build .
mv DB\ Browser\ for\ SQLite.app /Applications
```

> If you want to build universal binary, change the `cmake` command to<br>
> `cmake -DcustomTap=1 -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64" ..`<br>
> Of course, this requires you to have an Apple Silicon Mac and an installation of formula starting with `db4sub`.

An icon for "DB Browser for SQLite" should now be in your main macOS Applications list, ready to launch.

#### Add the extension to the app bundle (Optional)

> **Note**: The following lines look a bit complicated, but are all commands that you need to run.

### Windows
#### Compiling on Windows with MSVC

Complete setup, build, and packaging instructions with MSVC 2013 x64 are online
here:

&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Setting-up-a-Win64-development-environment-for-DB4S

#### Cross compiling for Windows

These are instructions to cross compile within a Linux system a Windows binary
and installer.

Requirements:

* mxe cross compile environment â†’ http://mxe.cc
* cmake
* sqlitebrowser sources

Get the following mxe packages:

    make gcc sqlite qt nsis

After successful compilation go into your mxedir/usr/bin and add 3 symlinks:

    ln -s i686-pc-mingw32-windres windres
    ln -s i686-pc-mingw32-makensis makensis
    ln -s /usr/bin/lrelease

Now cd into your sqlitebrowser source directory and create a build directory
for the windows binary and create the correct makefiles:

    mkdir build-win
    cd build-win
    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path to mxe/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/share/cmake/mxe-conf.cmake ..

Before compiling we have to add the mxe/usr/bin directory to the PATH (so
windres and makensis can be found):

    export PATH=/path to mxe/usr/bin:$PATH

Now compile:

    make

If you additionally want an NSIS installer:

    make package

Done.

## Build with SQLCipher support

When built with SQLCipher support, DB Browser for SQLite will allow you to open
and edit databases encrypted using SQLCipher as well as standard SQLite3
databases.

Before compiling make sure you have the necessary SQLCipher development files
installed. On Linux this can usually be accomplished by just installing the
correct package (e.g. 'libsqlcipher-dev' on Debian-based distributions). On
macOS the easiest way is to install it via Homebrew ('brew install
sqlcipher'). On Windows unfortunately it's a bit more difficult: You'll have
to download and compile the code as described on the
[SQLCipher website](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) before you can proceed.

If SQLCipher is installed, simply follow the standard instructions for your
platform but enable the 'sqlcipher' build option by replacing any calls to
cmake like this:
```
If it says...			Change it to...
cmake				cmake -Dsqlcipher=1
cmake ..			cmake -Dsqlcipher=1 ..
```

## Building and running the Unit Tests

DB Browser for SQLite has unit tests in the "src/tests" subdirectory.

### Build the unit tests

The unit tests are enabled using the cmake variable `ENABLE_TESTING`<br>
it can be passed when running `cmake` to configure sqlitebrowser,
for example like this:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DENABLE_TESTING=ON ..
make
```

### Run the unit tests

Tests can be then run using `make test` or invoking `ctest` directly,
for example like this:

```
$ ctest -V
UpdateCTestConfiguration  from :SRCDIR/build/DartConfiguration.tcl
UpdateCTestConfiguration  from :SRCDIR/build/DartConfiguration.tcl

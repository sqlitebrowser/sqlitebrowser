This directory contains the SQLite lexer and parser files.

For convenience and to not have extra dependencies in the build process,
the generated C++ files are included here. Please don't edit them by hand.
To modify the lexer or parser, edit the sqlite3_lexer.ll or sqlite3_parser.yy
files and rerun flex or bison like this:

flex sqlite3_lexer.ll
bison sqlite3_parser.yy

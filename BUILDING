BUILD INSTRUCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS

SQLite Database Browser requires Trolltech's Qt, version 4.6.
For more information on QT please consult
http://www.qtsoftware.com. The GPL version of Qt is available in almost
all Linux distributions as a default package.

The only requirements for building this code are the presence of Qt and sqlite3.
Qt can be included as a static or shared library, depending on the current Qt
configuration on the building machine.

Provided you have Qt installed and configured, simply run

qmake

followed by

make

in the main directory. This will generate the sqlitebrowser (or
sqlitebrowser.exe, or sqlitebrowser.app) application in the src subdirectory.

The same process works for building the code
in any platform supported by Qt (including other Unix systems with
X11.)

Cross compile windows
=====================

These are instructions to cross compile within a Linux system a Windows binary and installer

Requirements:

  * mxe cross compile environment --> http://mxe.cc
  * cmake
  * sqlitebrowser sources

Get the following mxe packages:

  make gcc sqlite qt nsis

After successful compilation go into your mxedir/usr/bin and add 2 symlinks:

  ln -s i686-pc-mingw32-windres windres
  ln -s i686-pc-mingw32-makensis makensis

Now cd into your sqlitebrowser source directory and create a build directory for
the windows binary and create the correct makefiles:

  mkdir build-win
  cd build-win
  cmake /path to mxe/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/share/cmake/mxe-conf.cmake ..
  make

If additionaly want an NSIS install:

  make package

done.
